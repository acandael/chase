    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>After a successful workshop in Trondheim in 2015, we are pleased to invite you to CHASE, the 4th workshop on comparative health research.</p>
    <p>The main goal of the meeting is to share knowledge on theory as well as methods for comparative research in sociological epidemiology and health sociology.</p>
    <p>We want to focus on research contributing to the study of societies and social change and their consequences for population health.</p>
    <p>Apart from sessions organized around in-depth discussions of full high-quality papers, we plan time slots for a more informal exchange of ideas and enthusiasm.</p>
